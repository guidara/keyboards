# keyboards
These are custom keyboard layouts that I use in the [XKB format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_keyboard_extension).

## fr_de_US
This is a regular US keyboards with special characters added when using the `AltGr` key.

Although the keyboard is designed mainly for easy access to French and German characters&mdash;including the often missing œ/Œ, æ/Æ and capital ẞ&mdash;the characters for Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, [ALA-LC romanization of Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic#Comparison_table), and Icelandic are also included.

As long as `AltGr` is not used, this keyboard is identical to the US layout.

## ar_US
This is an Arabic keyboard based on the US layout.

Arabic letters are, where feasible, found on their most phonetically close Latin equivalent. Plain/[emphatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emphatic_consonant) pairs (e.g. س/ص) are on the same key (e.g. `s`), the emphatic letter being accessed with `Shift`.

Besides Arabic characters, this keyboard includes Persian letters as well as extra letters used in [Tunisian Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Arabic#Arabic_script) for non-native sounds (پ=`/p/`, ڨ=`/ɡ/`, ڥ=`/v/`).

This keyboard also includes both [Eastern Arabic and Persian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabic_numerals).
